# Movie Recommender System

This is a simple Movie Recommender System built using Streamlit and movie data from an kaggle dataset. The system recommends similar movies based on user input.

## About

This project demonstrates how to build a movie recommendation system using Python and Streamlit. It uses movie data from an API to calculate movie similarities and generate recommendations.

## Features
